Foreign to the formalistic debate between Futurism and Cubism in the first five years of the ten years and influenced instead by the symbolist culture of the late nineteenth century, the painter Giorgio De Chirico matured in Paris, where he met Max Jacob and Apollinaire, a personal compositional invention of figurative character.

In 1917 in Ferrara, with the collaboration of Carlo Carrà, this led to one of the main Futurist painters, in the creation of the artistic movement of the "Metaphysics". It can be understood both as a moment of recomposition of the figure after the radical break of the avant-gardes, of recovery of classical iconographies, and as a conceptual affirmation of the disorientation  caused to man by the new "alienated" condition of modern life.

The unexpected juxtaposition between objects, which De Chirico realized already in the Ten years, will be decisive for the birth of French Surrealism in the Twenties. In this section, the finder of De Chirico is compared to Chateau de Cartes by Andrè Masson, from 1924. In fact, the future surrealist painter practiced a sort of fusion between cubism and metaphysics which, before surrealism, tried to re-read cubism in the light of "Unsafe architecture", of the "stacking of objects" by De Chirico. Mario Sironi will also arrive at the metaphysical poetic,  slowly,  from  the poetic machinist of futurism.

He realizes a gradual reinterpretation of the futurist theme of the city, which he reinterpreted as an "unreal" desolation of urban suburbs. In the context of the development of futurism at the end of the 10s, a futurist artist, one of the creators of futuristic mechanical art, Vinicio Paladini, approached metaphysical painting in a key of bright colors.

Dadaism is considered by some important art historians to be active both in France and in Italy like Giovanni Lista as an extremization of some of the insights of Italian Futurism.

Dadaism, which was born in Zurich in 1916 with the opening of the Cabaret Voltaire by Hugo Ball and Emmy Hennings, and the immediate participation of Tristan Tzara and Hans Harp, is in fact indebted for both a close letters correspondence with the  protagonists of futurism is the main Marinettian idea of ​​destruction and zeroing of the past. Dadaism turns this principle of zeroing towards art itself, trying to de-aestheticize the work of art. Also on this side, the denial of verbal semantics up to the achievement of simple sound, the search for the brutal life of matter, also through the insertion of anomalous materials in the work, are all pre-Dadaist characters professed by Futurist aesthetics.

The Dadaist gesture that will be most influential in the history of the twentieth century, the presentation of a common object as a work of art, Duchamp's urinal in 1917, had its most immediate precedent in the "Wheel of the bicycle" of 1913, work that sought to resolve the debate between futurism and cubism on how to render movement in painting by presenting a real object.

The section presents a work on paper of 1923, made only with stamps, signatures and diagrams, by the German Kurt Schwitters, one of the greatest exponents of Dada, founder of the Berlin Dada, and three works by futurist artists, Fortunato Depero, Francesco Cangiullo and Antonio Fornari, characterized in a Dadaist sense, that is as a "force of negation". Dadaism had its most important representative in Italy in the philosopher and painter, first futurist, Julius Evola.
