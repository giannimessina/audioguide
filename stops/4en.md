The formal and poetic principles of Futurism and Cubism between 1911 and 1915 influenced each other, determining Robert Delaunay's "simultaneism" and "Orphic" cubism, which recovered the ringing tones of Futurism and the Futurist theme of simultaneity.

On display is a valuable study for the famous painting L'Équipe de Cardiff, from 1912-1913. Conversely, in 1911 there was the influence of Cubism on Boccioni, Carrà and Severini.

Boccioni drew and remodeled the Cubist styles trying to overcome them in the futurist sense, and in 1913 he came to the definition of "plastic dynamism", where the interpenetration of objects is considered in a vital and emotional sense and not as pure intellectual exercise.

Unlike Boccioni, Carrà and Severini, Giacomo Balla is not influenced by Cubist stylistic elements but rather by Marey's chronophotography, performing a search for gradual abstraction and then synthesis of optical multiplication caused by the displacement of objects in space. Balla's research came in 1914 to overcome the picture, conceiving the "plastic complexes", forms in which the furniture, the painting and the frame converge into a single object.

Other important exponents of Italian Futurism in these years are Enrico Prampolini, Mario Sironi and Arturo Ciacelli, resident in Paris. Futurism presented itself, at this point, as a movement consciously oriented towards a reform of society, of the relationship between art and life, not only to the developments of painting and sculpture.

Futurism and Cubism profoundly influenced Russian avant-garde research, that called itself the futurist cube, between 1912 and 1915. On display, there is a precious drawing by Natalia Gontcharova, who, with Mikhail Larionov, derived the principle of the "Raggista" movement from the concept of the lines of strength of the Futurist paintings that the two Russian painters had seen in Paris in 1912 on the occasion of the famous exhibition at the Galerie Brenheim Jeune. Another exponent of the Russian Cubism-Futurism, present in the exhibition, is the Georgian Kirill Zdanevic.

The final part of this first room presents an important work by Enrico Prampolini from 1920, Architecture in space, which highlights the reinterpretation of Cubism in a dynamic sense. This is followed by a close comparison between some "still lives", to show the different aesthetic conception expressed by Italian futurism through a typically Cubist theme.
