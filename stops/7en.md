At the height of the mid-twenties, in the full climate of "Futurist Mechanical Art", a trend that was then confronted with the post-cubist developments of French Purism and with the Bauhaus, Enrico Prampolini acknowledged the surrealist tendencies by recovering the form in his painting organic.

A new season opens up for futurism centered on the imagination of flight in an airplane and on metaphors of evolution in a cosmic sense of man. It is very interesting to see how, even if they stand on very close formal characters, two works such as Landscape of Capri, of 1932, of Prampolini, and Nu at Flamme Noire III, of André Masson, of 1944, maintain however a different character, much more extroverted that of Prampolini, as in a futuristic becoming of forms, not perturbing.

Elements of psychic alteration, somehow close to surrealism, are found instead in pictures of figurative accent of the epoch, where dream and flight become one, as in the masterpiece Aerocaccia II by Tullio Crali.
