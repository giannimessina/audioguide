The birth of the last of the historic avant-garde dates officially to 1924, the year of the drafting of the Manifesto of Surrealism written by André Breton. The manifesto, influenced by the reading of Freud's work, praised the dreamlike and irrational aspects of life, recovering the insights of Dadaism within a more rational and less radical context, to which was added the conceptual experience of metaphysics.

The exhibition launching the movement and  detaching it from the current Dada,  to whom many of the painters had joined in the past, takes place at the Pierre Galleries in Paris in 1925, with Max Ernst, Man Ray, André Masson, Joan Mirò.

This section of the exhibition presents important works created in the early years of the surrealist experience: Max Ernst's La Verre, 1923, Dessin Automatique, 1924, by André Masson, and a photograph from Man Ray's Le violon de Ingres series 1929. Some of Mirò's works will be presented later in the second part of the exhibition dedicated to the development of abstract art.

The surrealist poetics is articulated in a multimedia sense, already in these years on the two poles of an unexpected combination of disparate objects, as in Man Ray, which cause an alienating effect, and on the insertion of disparate elements within a pictorial composition more built.

Max Ernst, for example, famous for his "petrified forests", uses dark and calcified tones, as if the image had emerged from an obscure and precisely unconscious depth. The sensual, carnal painting of André Masson alternates brown tones with brighter inserts expressing a bloody and visceral world, where the tree branches or assume the value of hallucinations of the mind.

The theme of automatic design, that is realized in a state of subconsciousness, and new artistic techniques connected to this poetic, like the frottage of Max Ernst, are also represented in this room. While the aspect of surrealist poetry linked to sexual urges and his sadomasochistic articulations finds an emblematic example in Esquisse pour le manequin surrealiste, 1938, by André Masson.

In the second half of the Twenties, some younger artists adhered to surrealism, in particular the Spanish Salvador Dalì, who brought a clearer painting to the artistic current inspired also by classical and Renaissance painting. The works of Dalì, a skilled painter capable of mixing up the most diverse influences, appear as rationalized hallucinations, insisting above all on the unnatural juxtaposition between objects and on real dream narratives.

Attentive to the management of his image as an artist in terms that are more reminiscent of Marinetti's advertising activism than the Marxist positions of the French surrealist group, his work also represents a first meeting point between surrealism and pop art. The exhibition presents important oils such as Venere and putti, 1925, Anatomies, 1937, and Transforaciò d'una pintura from S.XVI de Matthias Gerunt, 1974, inspired by the work of the sixteenth-century master engraver Matthias Gerunt. In the Italian sphere, surrealism is reinterpreted by Alberto Savinio, brother of Giorgio De Chirico, who declines it in a concealed and conscious key, as a branch of the Metaphysics, as well as by the painter Leonor Fini.

The room also features a juxtaposition of two Futurist works and two works by Max Ernst, the first, where Transformation forms and spirits by Giacomo Balla and Printemps and the second, between La Verre and the photomontage by Tato, played on the comparison between the organic fetish in a futuristic key and in a surrealistic key.
