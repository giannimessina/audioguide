Strongly influenced by the French painting of the time, in the mid-twenties Juan Mirò embraced surrealism also modifying its composition in a more abstract sense on the basis of Paul Klee.

His paintings are often organized on red, black, and yellow colors and present a particular balance between abstract simplification and organic character, sometimes alluding to the symbols of nature and the cosmos.

The strong decorative wisdom, unity with the folkloric and visionary character of the compositions characterize the unique and recognizable style.

This room has some important works on paper, including a small drawing made in Rome in the 1980s, and an unprecedented juxtaposition with a large oil on canvas by the futurist painter Fortunato Depero, aimed at creating a symbiosis with his imaginary world of children and mechanic.
