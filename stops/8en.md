The debate on European abstract painting is initiated by the experiences of the German Blaue Reiter group (blue knight), composed by Wassilj Kandinskij, Paul Klee, and August Macke in 1911. In 1912, in Italy, Giacomo Balla began his experimentation on known colors as "iridescent interpenetration", showing one of the first examples of abstract art in Europe.

This room of the exhibition presents, on the right wall, an abstractionist line linked to the relationship between music and painting, which ran through the debate between the two fundamental European avant-garde groups, futurism and cubism and on the other two walls the work of Balla, Kandinskij and Klee.

Abstract art comes in a rhythmic and musical declination in the work of the futurist painter Luigi Russolo, and appears a sort of cosmic movement of the celestial vault in the rare abstractist production of the Umbrian futurist Gerardo Dottori.

A work by the Austrian Frantisec Kupka, who adhered to the Cubist section of Section d’Or, presents a further example of abstraction as an analogy between music and painting. Kandinskij's work is represented by three works: Mittengrun (green in the middle), 1932, Ohne titel, 1932, and Komposition n. 5, from 1940. The Kandinskian abstraction is expressed in synaesthetic forms with elementary geometries in aerial and musical consonance chords.

The point, the line, the triangle, are connected according to spiritual agreements that tend to awaken the human soul, as in an iteration between the fundamental values ​​of dynamism and stasis. The work of Paul Klee, a great friend of Kandinskij and as he taught at the Bauhaus in the past, constitutes one of the most important phases of experimentation on the possibilities of the "visible" in the history of twentieth-century art.

By linking primitivism, a sense of infantile form, cubism and abstractionism, Klee's work makes the forms visible at the time of their first appearance. 

Although apparently similar to surrealism - Klee exercised a decisive influence on Mirò and also participated in the first Surrealist exhibition of 1925 - Paul Klee's work stands out by not expressing the uncanny, as much as a search for the archetypes of the visible, as in the important work polymaterial shown here: Hier der bestellte wagen, 1935.
