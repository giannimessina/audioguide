In this room are presented three abstract works by artists that have already been presented in the previous rooms but which here are shown under a different profile.

Two of the three works are polymateric, "La Chasse" (the hunt) by Andrè Masson, of a surrealist character and "Drammatism of explosion", by Enrico Prampolini.

The polymaterial vein of European art, which ran between futurism and surrealism, up until the 1940s, will be decisive for some of the main informal post-war research, from Burri to Fontana.

Finally, there is a precious abstract work by the cubist master Fernand Léger, La racine noire, 1942.
