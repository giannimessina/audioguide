The first room of the exhibition presents a comparison between the Cubist decomposition and the Futurist dynamism, retracing the main events of art history from 1907 to 1915.

Developing an idea of ​​reconstructing the image of reality based on decompositions of the recomposed pictorial surface in his individual fragments through geometric shapes, Picasso and Braque arrived between 1907 and 1908 to reorganize the cubist pictorial space starting from the meditation on the work of Paul Cézanne.

The two painters, however, did not define themselves as an organized art group. The same definition of "cubism" is due to the critic Louis Vauxcelles, in 1909. It was instead the Italian futurism that, first of all, presented itself as an organized artistic movement, thus becoming the first artistic avant-garde of the twentieth century.

The term Cubism was placed at the center of the artistic debate from the exhibition at the Salon Des Indipendants in 1911, in which Ferdinand Léger participated and  whose drawing from 1912 is visible in the exhibition. The poet and painter Max Jacob was friend of Picasso and the "Montmartre group".

Also close to Cubist positions was the German painter and director Hans Richter, of whom a study was presented for "the violinist", dated 1914. The French painter Georges Valmier also professed Cubist painting, who then elaborated a Cubist approach to abstract art, as in the painting on display, Paysage et forêt, from 1924. The Futurist movement was born in February 1909 thanks to the founding manifesto of the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and already in 1910 he presented a "manifesto of futurist painters".

This, signed by Umberto Boccioni, Giacomo Balla, Carlo Carrà, Luigi Russolo and Gino Severini, presented a sort of dynamic exaltation of impressionism, considered as the first artistic movement capable of capturing the image and life in motion. In the first futurist reflection, which appears autonomous and parallel with respect to Cubist reflection, the subject is represented in different positions, spatial and temporal, thus making time and space, the present and the past simultaneous.

The Futurist palette is characterized by bright and complementary colors, placing itself in stark contrast to the brown tones of Cubism. While in Futurism the multiplication of the subject in space and time is conceived as a dynamic synthesis of the frenetic action of modern man and his new perception of the world, in Cubism the object recomposed on the canvas and analyzed in its multiple aspects is static.

While the multiple perspectives depicted by the futurists in their paintings are actively configured in the eyes of the viewer, making the picture itself dynamic, the cubist figures present themselves as stuck in a mental distance.
