The invention of the movement in and through photography is due to the English artist Eadweard Muybridge in the 1870s.

Hired by the Californian magnate Leland Stanford to understand if the horse detached from the ground during the race, Muybridge invented a method to take a sequence of photographs thanks to a device that activated the animal as he ran and managed to photograph it while it was suspended in the air.

Bringing together the various photographs taken during this experiment, Muybridge invented tables that, in their sequence, reproduced the race of the horse. These plates, published in collotypes, had an immediate commercial success and a wide diffusion in the Europe of the time. Muybridge began to photograph subjects unrelated to scientific research with this method, making his photographic compositions more and more artistic and guided by inspiration.

Sometimes the trajectories traced by the athletes photographed by him take on an almost abstract character: they are primordial representations of energy flows. At other times in his works appear daily gestures, like two lovers kissing. His series dedicated to sports are famous: pole vaulters, high jumpers, long jumpers, jump walkers, javelin throwers, stone throwers. In 1879, Muybridge devised a sort of magic lantern which, when rotated, showed the images in motion.

The Zoopraxiscope is born, a form of primordial cinema. Muybridge's work was continued shortly thereafter by the French photographer Étienne-Jules Marey, who came to record the movement of objects and bodies in the same photograph. Both the two photographers exerted an important influence on the Futurist painters in the 1910s.

In particular it was Giacomo Balla who, inspired by them, analyzed with drawings and paintings the multiplied image, caused by impressions on the retina, of a body moving in space. Balancing the object according to the phases of his movement, Balla came to understand the essential forces, and to represent them in the abstract.

The wall of this first room of the exhibition brings together some original photographs of Muybridge and a valuable study on the dynamism of the flight of a swallow by Giacomo Balla, from 1912.
