"We are on the extreme promontory of the centuries! ...Why should we look behind us if we want to break through the mysterious doors of the impossible?"

So  Filippo Tommaso Marinetti wrote  in 1909, in the Manifesto of the Foundation of Futurism. Soon all over Europe, this would have been the aesthetic and formal, conceptual revolution  influencing  the entire century to come.

Futurism, Cubism, Metaphysics, Dada, Surrealism are the main revolutionary movements of the first half of the twentieth century. Movements that always experimented by searching  the unprecedented and, precisely, of what until then had been considered impossible or would not have been considered "art".

The exhibition shows the main artists. In a short space of time, a mental, polyprospectic conception of image is born, the idea of ​​pictorial fiction that, overcoming itself, enters concrete reality, a conception of art no longer limited to traditional techniques,  which instead,  wants to affect everyday life and society, and brings society within itself.

After the mid-1990s, while the devastation of the First World War was taking place, the destructive spirit of Italian Futurism is gathered by the Dadaist movement, which not only wants to deny the way in which until then it had become art, but wants to deny the art itself, welcoming  randomness, game and the irrational.

In the second half of 1910s , in contrast to the avant-garde destruction, a reconstruction of the pictorial image is produced, apparently at the opposite pole of the Dada: the Metaphysical art. But Metaphysics, while using accurate figurative painting, narrates and represents the dismemberment of man and knowledge, which reflects his existential condition.

In the 1910s, in parallel to the Cubist and Futurist research on form, the birth of abstract painting is determined throughout Europe, but especially in Germany, which will have two of its greatest artists in Klee and Kandinskij, and in their "lyrical abstraction ".

It is instead again in France that, in the mid-twenties, the irrational and destructive force of the Dada is recanalized in the work of surrealist art, which elaborates the manifestations of the human unconscious considering them as the only authentic expression of freedom.

The exhibition, presenting works by great artists such as Picasso, Braque, Boccioni, Balla, Severini, De Chirico, Klee, Kandinskij, Masson, Max Ernst, Dalì, Mirò, wants to retrace the most important half-century of the art of the last 100 years and  to train the eye and the mind to the perception of these different aesthetic and thought currents, which, once  placed side by side, better express their essence, in their opposition and difference,  sometimes in their conflict.
